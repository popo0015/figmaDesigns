# 🎨 My Figma Designs Repository

Welcome to my Figma Designs repository! 🚀 This space is all about sharing my journey in UX/UI design, showcasing my progress, and exploring dynamic methods to present my designs. As a new designer 🌱, I aim to create intuitive, impactful, and visually appealing designs that resonate with users and meet their needs effectively.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository is organized in a way to ensure ease of access and to demonstrate the evolution of my design skills over time. For now, it's structured with a separate folder for each project, allowing you to see the variety of designs I'm working on:

- **Project Folders**: Each project has its own folder, containing all the relevant designs, iterations, and final versions. This setup helps in showcasing the development process for each individual design effort.

Updates and more flowing structure will be present and regularly updated in the repository Wiki page.

## 🚀 About My Journey
